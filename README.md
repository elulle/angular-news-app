# angular-news-app
To teach myself angular 1 I am creating a newsfeed web-app where you can view different news from different news sources.

# Getting started
## What you will need:
install http-server using `npm install http-server -g`

## Get it up and running
run `http-server`
open http://localhost:8080/
